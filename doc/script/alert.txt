============
script.Alert
============

Used within Python's `warnings` framework to warn users of the command-line
utility `csx` about conditions which, while not fatal errors, are potentially
problematic. ::

    >>> import warnings

    >>> from script import Alert

    >>> # For demonstration purposes - don't do this in real code.
    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.stderr = sys.stdout

    >>> warnings.warn(Alert("squee")) # doctest:+SKIP
    (...):1: Alert: squee

It inherits from `UserWarning`, to which it adds no extra behviour.
